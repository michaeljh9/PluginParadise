# PluginParadise
By default, the out-of-the-box behavior qBittorrent has is it does not have any search plugins installed. Users are encouraged to visit the qbittorrent/search-plugins repository and download the plugins for their search engines of choice:

How awesome would it be to automate this process?

I made a script that automates the download of the public ones.

Run this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/michaeljh9/PluginParadise.git && cd PluginParadise && python qbittorrent-search-plugin-downloader.py
```

First, have the search tab enabled:
